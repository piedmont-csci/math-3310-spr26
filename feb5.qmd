Let's suppose that $X_i\sim B(20, 0.67)$. Our goal is to estimate $n=20$ and $p = 0.67$.

We found in class the method of moments estimators $\hat p = 1 - \frac{M2 - M1^2}{M1}$ and $\hat n = \frac{M1}{\hat p}$. Now let's generate a bunch of random binomially distributed data with the parameters that we secretly know and see how well we did.

```{r}
x <- rbinom(1000, 20, 0.67)
M1 <- mean(x)
M2 <- mean(x^2)
pHat <- 1 - (M2 - M1^2)/M1
nHat <- M1 / pHat
c(nHat, pHat)
```

Now suppose $X_i\sim U(2, 28)$. Our goal is to estimate $a = 2$ and $b = 28$.

We found in class the method of moments estimators $\hat a = M1 - \sqrt{3M_2 - 3M_1^2}$ and $\hat b = M1 + \sqrt{3M_2 - 3M_1^2}$. Let see how we did:

```{r}
x <- runif(1000, 2, 28)
M1 <- mean(x)
M2 <- mean(x^2)
aHat <- M1 - sqrt(3*M2 - 3*M1^2)
bHat <- M1 + sqrt(3*M2 - 3*M1^2)
c(aHat, bHat)
```
