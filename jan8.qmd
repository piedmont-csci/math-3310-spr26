# Statistical Graphics

We will use the software platform R to do many computations.

R comes with various builtin datasets to play around with.

```{r}
HairEyeColor
```

There are various ways to represent data visually using graphics. One example is a "mosaic plot":

```{r}
mosaicplot(~ Eye + Sex, data=HairEyeColor)
```

Visually, it appears that hair and eye color may be independent from sex, but eye and hair color may be dependent on each other.

We can import data sets using the **scan** function:

```{r}
speed.of.light <- scan("michelson1.d")
sort(speed.of.light)
stem(speed.of.light)
```

```{r}
hist(speed.of.light)
```

Based on these graphics, it appears that these measurements may come from a normal distribution.

```{r}
boxplot(speed.of.light)
```

```{r}
quantile(speed.of.light, c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))
```

```{r}
plot.ecdf(speed.of.light, ylab="F_n(x)")
```

```{r}
help(plot.ecdf)
```
